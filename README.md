# Topology-Taker

Scan an object to make its topology. The device should be on the tool, the
topology should be according to the machine point of view.

Uses the [Delaunay library](https://github.com/eloraiby/delaunay), see the
license there.

Important note: this is not written to be portable. Classes are modified when
needed, functionnalities appear when needed. **This is just for prototyping and
not to be released**.

Therefore, the code is disgusting and I am ashamed to push that in a public
repository.
